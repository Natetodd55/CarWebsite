# CarWebsite
Very simple CRUD website for my first Web Dev. class.
Website includes Log-ins, Car Databases, password updaters.
When website is open you have 3 initial choices: Home, Create, and Login. If not login exists and you attempt to log in, nothing will happen.
You must first click on the create link and make an account. Once an account is created you will be logged into that account and the links available will change.
The new links include read, logout, update password, and add car. Logout does what it says and logs you out of your account, you will then have the choice to
either log back in or make a new account. Update password will allow you to change the password to your account, only after you verify your old password. 
Add car lets you create a car with a make, model, and year. This car is stored in a database under your name and account. Your cars can be seen, updated, or removed in
the read link.
